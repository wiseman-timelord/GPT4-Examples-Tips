# GPT4-Examples-Tips

### STATUS: WORKING
- There is no one way to AI program, as there is no 1 standard output from AI.

## DESCRIPTION
This guide is designed to assist users in effectively programming and debugging using GPT-4. It provides a structured approach to script development, problem-solving, and optimization for various applications. The guide focuses on enhancing the interaction with GPT-4, improving the quality of inputs for better AI responses, and honing in on specific issues through a process of detailed examination and refinement. It's particularly useful for scripting in environments where accuracy and efficiency are paramount, such as financial trading algorithms or complex data analysis.

## USAGE
TXT #1 - Initial Script Analysis: Enhance basic scripts with GPT-4's analysis, focusing on function and logic insights.
TXT #2 - Problem Identification and Debugging/Refinement and Focus: Address and resolve execution issues, leveraging GPT-4 for problem diagnosis and script optimization.
TXT #3 - Error Analysis and Function Updates: Analyze errors and update functions, using a structured approach for error interpretation and script adjustments.
TXT #4 - Errors in GPT's response after submitting everything you thought was relevant to fixing an error, re-editing the submission to steer output to the correct solution. 


### NOTATION
-  While minimal, I hope it inspires some insight, to what I have spent months doing, to, assist in and/or improve upon, peoples own AI programming techniques.
